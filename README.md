# Sudoku Solver with Search Algorithms

This project implements a Sudoku game with various search algorithms for solving puzzles. Players can choose from different algorithms and compare their performance metrics.

## Available Search Algorithms

1. Uninformed Search Algorithms:
   - Depth-First Search (DFS)
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
   - Uniform Cost Search

2. Informed Search Algorithms:
   - A* Search
   - Best-First Search

3. Local Search Algorithms:
   - Hill Climbing
   - Simulated Annealing

4. Constraint Satisfaction:
   - Backtracking
   - Forward Checking
   - AC-3 Algorithm

## Performance Metrics
- Number of steps
- Execution time
- Space complexity
- Initial state
- Target state

## Setup
1. Install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the game:
```bash
python main.py
```
